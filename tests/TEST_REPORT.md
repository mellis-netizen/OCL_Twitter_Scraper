## Test Scenarios Covered

### API Endpoint Tests

#### 1. Trigger Button Functionality
```python
POST /monitoring/trigger
- ✅ Returns 200 OK status
- ✅ Returns valid session_id (UUID format)
- ✅ Returns success message
- ✅ Non-blocking (returns < 2 seconds)
- ✅ Creates MonitoringSession in database
- ✅ Starts background thread
- ✅ Handles concurrent requests
```

#### 2. Progress Tracking
```python
GET /monitoring/session/{id}/progress
- ✅ Returns progress for valid session
- ✅ Returns 404 for invalid session
- ✅ Includes all metrics (articles, tweets, alerts, feeds, errors)
- ✅ Calculates progress percentage by phase
- ✅ Updates current_phase field
- ✅ Response time < 500ms
```

#### 3. Session Results
```python
GET /monitoring/session/{id}
- ✅ Returns complete session results
- ✅ Includes start and end times
- ✅ Shows all processing metrics
- ✅ Includes error log if failures occurred

GET /monitoring/sessions/recent
- ✅ Returns list of recent sessions
- ✅ Respects limit parameter
- ✅ Orders by start_time descending
```

### Database Integration Tests

#### 1. Real-time Updates
```python
- ✅ MonitoringSession created on trigger
- ✅ performance_metrics updated during cycle
- ✅ Phase transitions tracked correctly
- ✅ Metrics increment as processing occurs
- ✅ Session marked "completed" when done
- ✅ End time recorded on completion
```

#### 2. Alert Creation
```python
- ✅ Alerts created during scraping
- ✅ Alerts linked to companies
- ✅ Alert count increases in statistics
- ✅ Recent alerts include new items
- ✅ Alert filters work correctly
```

#### 3. Feed Statistics
```python
- ✅ success_count increments
- ✅ last_fetch timestamp updates
- ✅ tge_alerts_found accumulates
- ✅ Feed health indicators update
```

### End-to-End Workflow Tests

#### Complete Scraping Cycle
```
1. User clicks "Start Scraping Cycle" button
   ✅ Button disabled
   ✅ Progress bar appears
   ✅ Timer starts

2. API triggers monitoring
   ✅ Session created in database

3. Scraping executes
   ✅ News articles scraped
   ✅ Twitter feeds monitored
   ✅ Keywords analyzed
   ✅ Alerts generated

4. Database updated
   ✅ Session metrics updated real-time
   ✅ Alerts saved to database
   ✅ Feed statistics incremented
   ✅ Companies linked to alerts

5. Frontend refreshes
   ✅ Query invalidation triggered
   ✅ Statistics refetched

   ✅ Button re-enabled
```

### Error Handling Tests

#### 1. Network Failures
```python
- ✅ Graceful handling of API timeouts
- ✅ Error message displayed to user
- ✅ Session marked as "failed"
- ✅ Error log populated
- ✅ Partial progress saved
```

#### 2. Database Errors
```python

- ✅ No resource conflicts
- ✅ Database transactions isolated
```

### Performance Tests

#### 1. Response Times
```python
- ✅ Trigger endpoint: < 2 seconds
- ✅ Progress endpoint: < 500ms
- ✅ Statistics endpoint: < 1 second
- ✅ Health check: < 500ms
```

#### 2. Database Query Efficiency
```python
- ✅ Statistics queries optimized
- ✅ Index usage verified
- ✅ Connection pooling active
- ✅ Query performance acceptable with 50+ alerts
```

#### 3. Concurrent Load
```python

- ✅ No deadlocks
- ✅ All complete successfully
- ✅ Database handles load
```

### Edge Case Tests

#### 1. Empty Database
```python
- ✅ Scraping works with no feeds
- ✅ No companies doesn't break system
- ✅ Zero alerts handled gracefully
```

#### 2. Incomplete Sessions
```python
- ✅ Session without metrics displays correctly
- ✅ Partial completion state valid
- ✅ Progress calculation handles missing data
```

#### 3. Boundary Conditions
```python
- ✅ Session age > 5 minutes detected
- ✅ Phase progress at 0% and 100%
- ✅ Empty performance_metrics handled
```

## Integration Points Tested

### Frontend ↔ Backend
```
React Component → API Endpoint → Database
     ↓              ↓              ↓
  Button         /monitoring/    MonitoringSession
  Click          trigger         created
     ↓              ↓              ↓

  Stats          Invalidation    system
```

### Database Flow
```
1. MonitoringSession created (status: "running")
2. performance_metrics updated with phase
3. articles_processed, tweets_processed increment
4. Alert records created
5. Feed statistics updated
6. MonitoringSession completed (status: "completed")
7. End time recorded
```

### Query Invalidation
```
On completion, invalidate:
- ['statistics']      → Dashboard metrics
- ['feeds']           → Feed list and stats
- ['alerts']          → Alert list
- ['companies']       → Company data
- ['health']          → System health

Delayed refetch after 3s:
- ['feeds']           → Catch delayed updates
- ['statistics']      → Final metric refresh
```

2. **Add more mocks:** Reduce external dependencies
3. **Improve isolation:** Tests should not depend on each other
4. **Add fixtures:** Reusable test data and setup

### Medium Term
1. **Increase coverage:** Target 80%+ code coverage
2. **Add E2E tests:** Full browser automation with Selenium/Playwright
3. **Load testing:** Test with realistic data volumes
4. **Security testing:** Validate auth and authorization thoroughly

### Long Term
1. **CI/CD Integration:** Automated testing on every commit
2. **Performance benchmarks:** Track and alert on regressions
3. **Chaos testing:** Test resilience under failure conditions
4. **Production monitoring:** Real-time test results from production
