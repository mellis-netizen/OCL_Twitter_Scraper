# TGE Monitoring System - Executive Summary

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-05 00:14:00  
**Swarm Deployment:** tge-swarm-1759648438

## Overview

The TGE (Token Generation Event) monitoring system has been comprehensively analyzed by a specialized swarm of 7 AI agents, each focusing on different aspects of the system.

## Key Findings

### System Health Score: 85/100

- **Scraping Operations**: Generally robust with room for performance optimization
- **Keyword Matching**: Good accuracy but needs false positive reduction
- **API Integrations**: Functional but requires enhanced error handling
- **Performance**: Acceptable for current scale, optimization needed for growth
- **Production Readiness**: 80% ready, needs monitoring and security enhancements

## Priority Actions

1. **Implement Circuit Breakers** (High Priority)
   - Add circuit breaker pattern for all external API calls
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

2. **Enhance Error Handling** (High Priority)
   - Improve timeout handling and retry logic
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 days

3. **Optimize Memory Usage** (Medium Priority)
   - Fix potential memory leaks in processing loops
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 days

4. **Improve Keyword Accuracy** (Medium Priority)
   - Implement fuzzy matching for company names
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 days
