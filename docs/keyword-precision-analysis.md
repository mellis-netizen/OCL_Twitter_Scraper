## 1. Current Keyword Assessment

### High-Confidence Keywords (55 total)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Core TGE terms well-covered: "TGE", "token generation event", "token launch"
- ✅ Airdrop terminology comprehensive: "airdrop", "claim airdrop", "airdrop is live"
- ✅ Trading signals: "token listing", "trading goes live", "IDO", "IEO"
- ✅ Distribution patterns: "token claim", "claim portal", "distribution event"

**Weaknesses/Gaps:**
- ❌ Missing live action phrases: "token claim live", "claiming portal open", "claim window open"
- ❌ Missing temporal urgency: "distribution begins today", "tokens available now"
- ❌ Missing completion signals: "token generation complete", "mainnet token deployed"
- ❌ Missing snapshot terminology: "airdrop snapshot taken", "eligibility snapshot"
- ❌ Missing vesting signals: "vesting begins", "token unlock event", "cliff period ends"
- ❌ Missing portal/interface terms: "claim page live", "staking portal open"
- ❌ Missing participation terms: "whitelist live", "public sale begins", "token sale round"
- ❌ Missing community launch: "community airdrop", "retroactive distribution"

**False Positive Risks:**
- 🟡 "token allocation" - often in tokenomics discussions, not launches
- 🟡 "tokenomics revealed" - can be early planning, not imminent TGE
- 🟡 "token model" - theoretical discussions

### Medium-Confidence Keywords (23 total)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Mainnet signals: "mainnet launch", "mainnet deployment", "mainnet is live"
- ✅ Token economics: "tokenomics", "token vesting", "token unlock"
- ✅ Exchange listings: "exchange listing", "dex listing", "cex listing"

**Weaknesses/Gaps:**
- ❌ Missing rollup/L2 terms: "rollup token", "L2 token launch", "sequencer token"
- ❌ Missing governance activation: "governance live", "voting begins", "DAO launch"
- ❌ Missing bridge events: "bridge token live", "cross-chain launch"
- ❌ Missing staking events: "staking live", "stake to earn", "staking rewards begin"
- ❌ Missing migration events: "token migration", "contract migration", "token swap event"

**False Positive Risks:**
- 🟡 "mainnet launch" - could be tokenless protocol launch
- 🟡 "liquidity pool" - general DeFi operations, not TGE specific
- 🟡 "beta launch" - often pre-token testing phase

### Low-Confidence Keywords (17 total)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Generic temporal markers: "coming soon", "next week", "Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4"
- ✅ Announcement indicators: "announce", "announcing", "big news"

**Weaknesses/Critical Issues:**
- ❌ Too generic - these create most false positives
- ❌ "partnership with" - very common, rarely TGE-related
- ❌ "big news" - extremely vague
- ❌ "milestone" - could be any achievement

**Recommendations:**
- Require multiple low-confidence keywords + company name
- Increase threshold for low-confidence matches
- Remove or severely weight down: "big news", "milestone", "important update"

## 4. Context-Aware Scoring Enhancements

### Current Scoring System (Lines 138-257)

**Strengths:**
- Token symbol detection (+15 base, +25 if matches company)
- Company detection (+20 base, +10 for high priority)
- Tiered keyword scoring (High: +30, Medium: +20, Low: +10)
- Proximity bonus (+20 for company+keyword within 200 chars)
- Exclusions penalty (-30)

**Weaknesses & Improvements:**

#### 1. Source Reliability Weighting (MISSING)
```python
# Current: No source weighting
# Proposed:
TIER_1_SOURCES = ['theblock.co', 'coindesk.com', 'decrypt.co']  # +15 points
TIER_2_SOURCES = ['cointelegraph.com', 'thedefiant.io']  # +10 points
TIER_3_SOURCES = [...]  # +5 points
```

#### 2. Temporal Relevance Scoring (PARTIAL)
```python
# Current: Generic urgency detection (+15)
# Proposed:
IMMEDIATE_INDICATORS = ['now', 'live', 'today', 'just launched']  # +20
NEAR_TERM = ['tomorrow', 'this week', 'next week']  # +15
MID_TERM = ['this month', 'Q1', 'Q2']  # +10
VAGUE_TIMING = ['soon', 'coming']  # +5
PAST_TENSE = ['launched', 'went live', 'was announced']  # -10 (retrospective)
```

#### 3. Content Section Weighting (MISSING)
```python
# Proposed:
- Title/Headline mentions: +25 points
- First paragraph (0-300 chars): +20 points
- Main body: +10 points (current default)
- Footer/disclaimers: -5 points
```

#### 4. Multiple Company Mentions (WEAK)
```python
# Current: Just adds +20 per company
# Proposed:
- Single high-priority company: +20
- Multiple high-priority companies: +35 (coordinated launch?)
- Mixed priority companies: +15 (possibly ecosystem news)
```

#### 5. Negative Keyword Scoring (PARTIAL)
```python
# Current: -30 for any exclusion
# Proposed:
HARD_EXCLUSIONS = ['testnet', 'test token', 'mock']  # -50 (definite no)
SOFT_EXCLUSIONS = ['analysis', 'prediction', 'review']  # -20 (likely no)
CONTEXT_DEPENDENT = ['game', 'coffee', 'fabric']  # -30 if no crypto context
```

#### 6. Engagement/Authority Signals (TWITTER ONLY)
```python
# Proposed for Twitter:
- Verified account: +10
- High engagement (1000+ likes): +15
- Official company account: +25
- Retweet from official: +20
- Reply/thread: -10 (often discussion, not announcement)
```

    "Caldera announces TGE for $CAL token on March 15th",
    "Fhenix airdrop snapshot taken - check eligibility now",
    "Curvance token claim portal is now live at claim.curvance.fi",

    "Fabric announces token generation event and trading begins tomorrow"
]
```

#### 2. False Positive Tests (Should NOT Match)
```python
false_positive_cases = [
    "I bought some fabric softener at the store",
    "Yellowstone caldera showing increased volcanic activity",
    "Best espresso machines for your coffee shop",
    "NFT treasure hunt game launching new in-game tokens",
    "My analysis of Bitcoin's token economics"
]
```

#### 3. Edge Cases (Context-Dependent)
```python
edge_cases = [
    "Fabric cryptography mainnet launch planned for Q2",  # Should match
    "Game tokens don't matter in traditional treasure hunts",  # Should not match
    "Caldera announces new rollup with native token",  # Should match
]
```

#### 4. Company Disambiguation Tests
```python
disambiguation_tests = [
    ("Fabric Protocol announces token launch", True),

    ("Caldera raises $15M for rollup infrastructure", True),
    ("Scientists study volcanic caldera formation", False)
]
```

## 9. Monitoring & Continuous Improvement

### Key Metrics to Track:

1. **Precision Rate** (Target: 95%+)
   - True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

2. **Recall Rate** (Target: 85%+)
   - True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

3. **False Positive Rate** (Target: <5%)
   - False Positives / (False Positives + True Negatives)

4. **Confidence Distribution**
   - Track alerts by confidence tier (70%+, 40-70%, <40%)
   - Aim for 80%+ of alerts in 70%+ tier

5. **Company-Specific Accuracy**
   - Track precision per company
   - Identify companies needing better disambiguation

### Feedback Loop:

```python
# Implement feedback system
def record_false_positive(alert, reason):
    """Track false positives for continuous learning"""
    # Store false positive patterns
    # Update exclusion rules
    # Adjust scoring weights
    pass

def record_missed_tge(content, company):
    """Track missed TGE announcements"""
    # Identify missing keywords
    # Adjust sensitivity
    pass
```
