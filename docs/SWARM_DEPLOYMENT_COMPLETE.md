## üéØ How to Use the System

### Quick Start
```bash
# Initialize the swarm
chmod +x *.sh *.py
./tge-safla-init.sh

# Run full analysis (simulated)
./tge-queen-orchestrator.sh

# Monitor with dashboard
./tge-queen-dashboard.sh
```

### Interactive Dashboard
```bash
# Commands available:
./tge-queen-dashboard.sh start     # Start orchestrator
./tge-queen-dashboard.sh status    # Show status
./tge-queen-dashboard.sh reports   # List reports  
./tge-queen-dashboard.sh logs      # View logs
./tge-queen-dashboard.sh reset     # Reset system
```

### Python Testing
```bash
# Test deployment system
python3 deploy-swarm.py

# Test memory coordinator
python3 swarm-memory-coordinator.py test
python3 swarm-memory-coordinator.py status
```

## üìà Generated Reports

After running the analysis, comprehensive reports are generated:

### `/reports/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
- High-level findings and system health score
- Prioritized action items with effort estimates
- Immediate, short-term, and long-term recommendations
- Agent analysis summary

### `/reports/TECHNICAL_FINDINGS.md`
- Detailed technical analysis from all agents
- Cross-cutting issues affecting multiple components
- Performance metrics and baselines
- Prioritized recommendations by severity

### `/reports/SWARM_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.json`
- Complete deployment metadata
- Agent configurations and specializations
- Memory coordinator status
- Timestamp and deployment tracking

## üîß Architecture Highlights

### Swarm Coordination Pattern
```yaml
# Each agent has specialized focus
scraping-specialist:
  focus: ["rate-limiting", "scraping-efficiency"]
  files: ["src/news_scraper*.py", "src/twitter_monitor*.py"]

keyword-analyzer:
  focus: ["keyword-accuracy", "false-positive-reduction"]
  files: ["config.py", "src/main*.py"]
```

### Memory Sharing System
```python
# Agents store findings in shared memory
memory_id = coordinator.store_memory(
    agent_id="scraping-specialist",
    memory_type="analysis",
    content=findings
)

# Cross-pollination between agents
coordinator.cross_pollinate(
    target="performance-optimizer",
    sources=["scraping-specialist", "api-guardian"],
    focus=["api-performance", "resource-usage"]
)
```

### Synthesis & Intelligence
```python
# Queen synthesizes all findings
synthesis = coordinator.synthesize_findings()
# Results in comprehensive analysis across all domains
```

## üéØ Integration with Existing System
