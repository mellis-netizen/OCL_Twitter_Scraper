# Security Fixes Verification Checklist

This checklist helps verify that all security fixes have been properly applied and are working correctly.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables

- [ ] **ADMIN_PASSWORD** is set and is at least 12 characters
  ```bash
  # Generate secure password
  export ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
  echo "Password length: ${#ADMIN_PASSWORD}"  # Should be >= 12
  ```

- [ ] **DATABASE_URL** points to PostgreSQL in production
  ```bash
  echo $DATABASE_URL
  # Should start with: postgresql://
  ```

- [ ] **ENV** is set to 'production' for production deployments
  ```bash
  export ENV=production
  ```

- [ ] **SECRET_KEY** is set for JWT tokens
  ```bash
  export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
  ```

### 2. Code Verification

- [ ] **auth.py** changes applied (lines 47-65 and 360-412)
  ```bash
  cd /Users/apple/Documents/GitHub/OCL_Twitter_Scraper
  grep -n "ADMIN_PASSWORD is REQUIRED" src/auth.py
  # Should show line ~375
  ```

- [ ] **database.py** changes applied (lines 29-49)
  ```bash
  grep -n "SQLite is not supported in production" src/database.py
  # Should show line ~38
  ```

- [ ] Python syntax is valid
  ```bash
  python3 -m py_compile src/auth.py
  python3 -m py_compile src/database.py
  # Should complete without errors
  ```

### 3. Security Tests

- [ ] Test admin password requirement
  ```bash
  # This should FAIL without ADMIN_PASSWORD
  unset ADMIN_PASSWORD
  python3 src/api.py
  # Expected: RuntimeError about ADMIN_PASSWORD
  ```

- [ ] Test admin password length validation
  ```bash
  # This should FAIL with short password
  export ADMIN_PASSWORD="short"
  python3 src/api.py
  # Expected: ValueError about password length
  ```

- [ ] Test SQLite production block
  ```bash
  # This should FAIL with SQLite in production
  export ENV=production
  export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///test.db"
  python3 src/api.py
  # Expected: RuntimeError about SQLite in production
  ```

- [ ] Test valid configuration
  ```bash
  # This should SUCCEED
  export ENV=production
  export ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
  export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/tge_monitor"
  export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
  python3 src/api.py
  # Expected: Application starts successfully
  ```

## Runtime Verification

### 1. Application Startup

- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] No auto-generated passwords in logs
- [ ] Admin user created successfully
- [ ] Database connection established

### 2. Authentication

- [ ] Admin login works with configured password
- [ ] Invalid passwords are rejected
- [ ] Password verification handles corrupted hashes gracefully
- [ ] JWT tokens are generated correctly

### 3. Database

- [ ] PostgreSQL connection is active
- [ ] Connection pooling is working
- [ ] No SQLite warnings in production logs

### 4. Logging

- [ ] Critical security messages use logger.critical()
- [ ] Invalid hash format logged as warnings
- [ ] System errors logged with stack traces
- [ ] No passwords in log files

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Security Audit

- [ ] No default/weak passwords in use
- [ ] All admin accounts use strong passwords
- [ ] Environment variables properly secured
- [ ] Database credentials encrypted/secured

### 2. Monitoring

- [ ] Set up alerts for authentication failures
- [ ] Monitor password verification errors
- [ ] Track database connection health
- [ ] Log all admin user creations

### 3. Documentation

- [ ] Team informed about password requirements
- [ ] Deployment procedures updated
- [ ] Incident response plan includes these changes
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented

## Quick Verification Script

Create and run this script to verify all changes:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# verify_security_fixes.sh

echo "=== Security Fixes Verification ==="
echo ""

# 1. Check files exist and have changes
echo "1. Checking files..."
if grep -q "ADMIN_PASSWORD is REQUIRED" src/auth.py; then
    echo "   ✓ auth.py: Admin password check in place"
else
    echo "   ✗ auth.py: Admin password check missing"
    exit 1
fi

if grep -q "SQLite is not supported in production" src/database.py; then
    echo "   ✓ database.py: SQLite production check in place"
else
    echo "   ✗ database.py: SQLite production check missing"
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Check syntax
echo ""
echo "2. Checking Python syntax..."
if python3 -m py_compile src/auth.py 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "   ✓ auth.py: Syntax valid"
else
    echo "   ✗ auth.py: Syntax errors"
    exit 1
fi

if python3 -m py_compile src/database.py 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "   ✓ database.py: Syntax valid"
else
    echo "   ✗ database.py: Syntax errors"
    exit 1
fi

# 3. Check environment variables
echo ""
echo "3. Checking environment variables..."
if [ -n "$ADMIN_PASSWORD" ]; then
    if [ ${#ADMIN_PASSWORD} -ge 12 ]; then
        echo "   ✓ ADMIN_PASSWORD: Set and valid length"
    else
        echo "   ⚠ ADMIN_PASSWORD: Too short (${#ADMIN_PASSWORD} chars, need 12+)"
    fi
else
    echo "   ⚠ ADMIN_PASSWORD: Not set (required for startup)"
fi

if [ -n "$DATABASE_URL" ]; then
    if [[ $DATABASE_URL == postgresql://* ]]; then
        echo "   ✓ DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL configured"
    elif [[ $DATABASE_URL == sqlite://* ]]; then
        if [ "$ENV" = "production" ]; then
            echo "   ✗ DATABASE_URL: SQLite in production!"
            exit 1
        else
            echo "   ⚠ DATABASE_URL: SQLite (OK for dev/test)"
        fi
    fi
else
    echo "   ⚠ DATABASE_URL: Not set"
fi

if [ -n "$SECRET_KEY" ]; then
    echo "   ✓ SECRET_KEY: Set"
else
    echo "   ⚠ SECRET_KEY: Not set (will use generated key)"
fi

echo ""
echo "=== Verification Complete ==="
echo ""
echo "Next steps:"
echo "1. Set any missing environment variables"
echo "2. Run test suite: pytest tests/"
echo "3. Start application and verify logs"
```

Make it executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x verify_security_fixes.sh
./verify_security_fixes.sh
```

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise, follow these steps:

1. **Immediate**: Stop the application
   ```bash
   pkill -f "python.*api.py"
   ```

2. **Rollback code** (if necessary)
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/auth.py src/database.py
   ```

3. **Set emergency admin password**
   ```bash
   export ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
   echo "Emergency admin password: $ADMIN_PASSWORD" | tee -a admin_password.txt
   ```

4. **Restart with safe defaults**
   ```bash
   export ENV=development
   python3 src/api.py
   ```

5. **Review logs** and fix the issue

6. **Re-apply fixes** once issue is resolved
