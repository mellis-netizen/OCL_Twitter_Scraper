## Key Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern
```python
class TGEEventRepository:
    """Abstract data access from business logic"""
    def create_event(self, event: TGEEvent) -> UUID
    def find_by_company(self, company: str) -> List[TGEEvent]
```

### Service Layer Pattern
```python
class TGEDetectionService:
    """Encapsulate business logic"""
    async def process_content(self, content: str) -> Optional[TGEEvent]
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```python
@circuit_breaker("twitter-api",
    failure_threshold=5,
    recovery_timeout=60)
async def fetch_tweets(query: str):
    """Protected external calls"""
```

### Event Bus Pattern
```python
class EventBus:
    """Publish-subscribe system"""
    events = {
        "tge.detected": [NotificationHandler, DatabaseHandler],
        "scraping.completed": [CoordinationHandler]
    }
```

```

### WebSocket API
```javascript
ws://localhost:8080/ws

// Subscribe to events
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "subscriptions": ["tge_detected", "metrics", "agent_status"]
}

// Real-time updates
