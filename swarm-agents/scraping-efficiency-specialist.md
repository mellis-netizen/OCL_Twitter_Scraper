## Analysis Methodology

### Phase 1: Performance Profiling (15 minutes)
```python
# Identify bottlenecks in scraping pipeline
1. Analyze request timing and patterns
2. Identify duplicate or redundant requests
3. Measure connection pool utilization
4. Profile memory usage during scraping
5. Identify blocking operations
```

### Phase 2: Code Review (30 minutes)
```python
# Systematic review of scraping code
1. Review async patterns and concurrent operations
2. Analyze caching strategies (or lack thereof)
3. Examine error handling and retry logic
4. Check rate limiting implementation
5. Verify resource cleanup
6. Identify code duplication
```

### Phase 3: Optimization Recommendations (20 minutes)
```python
# Generate actionable optimization plan
1. Quick wins (< 1 hour implementation)
2. Medium impact (1-3 hours implementation)
3. High impact (4-8 hours implementation)
4. Each with code examples and metrics
```
